Welcome to TEEM, a Django web application designed to help users explore the campus, become sustainable students, and earn points on our leaderboard. Our app provides an interactive and gamified experience that encourages users to explore the campus and learn more about sustainable living and how they can make a positive impact on out enviroment.

The Uni of Exeter Campus Explorer allows users to scan QR codes located throughout the campus, unlocking quizzes and articles that provide sustainable learning insights into the area where the code was found. The users earn points from completeting the quizzes and reading the articles, then they are placed on the app's leaderboard.

Our app is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, with a modern and intuitive interface that encourages engagement and exploration. Whether you're a new student or a visitor to the campus, our web app offers a fun and educational way to become a sustainable person.
