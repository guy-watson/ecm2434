Taariq - Possible leaderboard system to promote competitiveness
         Points on leaderboard can be used to redeem cosemetics for custom character, promotes more engagement and user retention

Guy - interactive learning enviroment where the user earns points for reading articles/gaining knowledge related to sustainability 

Kaloyan - Maybe like a learn to earn system with harder quizes giving more points?

James - Potentailly a system simialr to the app bereal, where randomly in the day, an alert goes off and you then have a set period of time, 
         maybe 2 hours or so where you have to find some litter and put in the bin. Prove it by taking a photo and uploading it, and if you
         complete say 7 days in a row, you get a reward of some degree. Could be a voucher for the campus shop or redeem cosmetics for your avatar 
         or something?  Not so much of a game so might not be the best idea but just a thought. Could be hard to create as well.
