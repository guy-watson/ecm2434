            The aim of the app is to promote sustainability through a fun and educating manner. Located around campus are QR codes and if you scan those, they will take you to a new webpage! You must be logged into an account in order to be able to view these webpages. From there, you can read about the ways in which you can be more sustainable at the exact location you scanned the QR code in, and finally, you can answer a related quiz and earn points! Your points will be displayed on a leaderboard so you can see how you're doing compared to your friends!
          </p>

	Get out and start exploring campus! Goodluck trying to find the QR codes!
